<p><strong>Data science</strong> is an interdisciplinary field that combines <strong><a href = "/Data_Science/math">math</a>,<a href = "/Data_Science/statistics">statistics</a>,programming,domain knowledge and data manipulation</strong> to extract insights and valuable information from structured and unstructured data. </p>
<p>The goal of data science is to leverage data to make informed decisions,predict future trends, and solve complex problems in various domains.</p>
<p>The data science process: </p>
<p><strong>1. Problem Definition: </strong>Understand what problem or question need to be solved with data.</p>
<p><strong>2. Data Collection: </strong>Gather relevant data from various sources, including databases, external APIs, or <a href = "/Data_Science/Scraping"> scraping.</a></p>
<p><strong>3. <a href = "/Data_Science/EDA">Data Exploration(EDA): </a></strong>Explore the data to understand its characteristics, identify trends, and detect anomalies.</p>
<p><strong>4. <a href = "/Data_Science/Data_Preprocessing">Data Preprocessing: </a></strong>Clean the data by handling missing values,scaling features and encoding categorical variables.</p>
<p><strong>6. Modeling: </strong>Apply <a href = "/Data_Science/machine_learning">machine learning</a> and <a href = "/Data_Science/deep_learning">deep learning</a> algorithms to build predictive or classification models.</p>
<p><strong>7. <a href = "/Data_Science/model_evaluation">Model Evaluation: </a></strong>Evaluate models perforemance using metrics.</p>
<p><strong>8. Model Deployment: </strong>Deploy the models in a production environment.</p>
<p><strong>9. Model Monitoring and Maintenance: </strong>Continuously monitor the models' performance and retrain it if necessary.</p>
