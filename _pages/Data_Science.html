<p><strong>Data science</strong> is an interdisciplinary field that combines <strong>math,statistics,programming,domain knowledge and data manipulation</strong> to extract insights and valuable information from structured and unstructured data. </p>
<p>The goal of data science is to leverage data to make informed decisions,predict future trends, and solve complex problems in various domains.</p>
<p>The data science process: </p>
<p><strong>1. Problem Definition: </strong>Understand what problem or question need to be solved with data.</p>
<p><strong>2. Data Collection: </strong>Gather relevant data from various sources, including databases, external APIs, or web scraping.</p>
<p><strong>3. Data Exploration(EDA): </strong>Explore the data to understand its characteristics, identify trends, and detect anomalies.</p>
<p><strong>4. Data Preprocessing: </strong>Clean the data by handling missing values,scaling features and encoding categorical variables.</p>
<p><strong>5. Feature Engineering: </strong>Create new features from the data to improve models' performance.</p>
<p><strong>6. Modeling: </strong>Apply machine learning algorithms to build predictive or classification models.</p>
<p><strong>7. Model Evaluation: </strong>Evaluate models perforemance using metrics.</p>
<p><strong>8. Model Deployment: </strong>Deploy the models in a production environment.</p>
<p><strong>9. Model Monitoring and Maintenance: </strong>Continuously monitor the models' performance and retrain it if necessary.</p>
