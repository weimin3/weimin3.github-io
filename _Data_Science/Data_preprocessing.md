Components of Data Processing:
Data Wrangling: Cleaning and transforming the raw data to make it suitable for analysis (handling missing values, correcting errors, etc.).
Data Integration: Combining data from multiple sources into a unified dataset.
Data Transformation: Applying various operations to make the data more usable (e.g., normalization, scaling, encoding).
Data Cleaning: Identifying and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from the dataset.
Feature Engineering: Creating new variables and modifying existing ones to improve the performance of models.
