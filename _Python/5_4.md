# What is a Sequence?
 A sequence is a data container that holds items **in a specific order**, allowing the use of index numbers to access elements. **Lists, tuples, and strings are examples of sequences**.

# What is Slicing?
Slicing is a technique used to extract a subset (or sub-sequence) from a sequence.

# Basic syntax
```python
sequence[start_index:end_index:step]
```
# Reverse a Sequence
```python
reversed_sequence = sequence[::-1]
```
# Exercise
Given the string "uoy era woh":
- Reverse the string to make it readable.
- Extract the word "are" from the string.
```python
s = "uoy era woh"
# Reverse the string to make it readable.
s_new = s[::-1]
print(f"Reversed string: {s_new}")

#Extract the word "are" from the string.
are_sub = s_new[4:7]
print(f"Extracted word: {are_sub}")S
```
Output:
```python
Reversed string: how are you
Extracted word: are
```
