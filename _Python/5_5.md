Sets are **unordered** collections of **unique elements**

# Defining a Set
- Literal format: `{element1, element2, ...}`
- Variable format: `my_set = {element1, element2, ...}`
- Empty set: `my_set = set()` ,**Note: {} is for defining a dictionary, not a set**.

# Characteristics of Sets
1. **Unordered**: The elements in a set do not have an order, so **cannot use indexing to access elements**.
2. **No duplicates**: Sets automatically ignore duplicate elements.

# Common Operations
1. Add a new element
```python
my_set.add(element)
```
2. Remove an element
```python
my_set.remove(element)
```
3. Pop a random element:Randomly removes and returns an element from the set.
```python
my_set.pop()
```
4. Clear the set:Removes all elements from the set.
```python
my_set.clear()
```
5. Set difference: elements in set1 that are not in set2
```python
new_set = set1.difference(set2)
```
6. Update set to remove common elements: Modifies set1 by removing the elements that are also in set2.
```python
set1.difference_update(set2)
```
7. Set union: combine two sets
```python
new_set = set1.union(set2)
```
8.Count elements in a set
```python
length = len(my_set)
```
9. Iterating Over a Set:Sets do not support indexing, so the only way to iterate over the elements is by using a `for` loop.
