# Definition of a Dictionary
A dictionary is defined using curly braces `{}` with key-value pairs inside: `{key: value, key: value, ...}`.Can assign a dictionary to a variable: `my_dict = {key: value, key: value, ...}`.
There are two ways to define an empty dictionary:`my_dict = {}` and `my_dict = dict()`

**Important Notes**
- Keys must be unique.
- Keys and Values can be any data type: Both keys and values can be any type, including numbers, strings, or even other dictionaries (allowing for nested dictionaries).
- Keys cannot be dictionaries: The key in a dictionary cannot be another dictionary, but values can be dictionaries (nested dictionaries).
- Dictionaries do not support `while` loops for direct traversal, but they do support `for` loops.

# Common Operations
1. Retrieving a value by key
```python
value = my_dict[key]
```
2. Retrieving data from nested dictionaries
```python
nested_value = my_dict[key][nested_key]
```
3. Adding a new key-value pair
```python
my_dict[key] = value
```
4. Updating an existing value
```python
my_dict[key] = new_value
```
5. Deleting a key-value pair
```python
removed_value = my_dict.pop(key)
```
6. Clearing a dictionary
```python
my_dict.clear()
```
7. Retrieving all keys
```python
keys = my_dict.keys()
```
8. Counting the number of key-value pairs
```python
count = len(my_dict)
```
9. Dictionary Traversal
- Method 1:
  ```python
  for key in my_dict.keys():
    print(key)
    print(my_dict[key])
  ```
- Method 2:
  ```python
  for key in my_dict:
    print(key)
    print(my_dict[key])
  ```
# Practice
Having a dictionary that stores the names of students and their grades in three subjects: math, science, and English.The task is to:
- Add a new subject and its grade for each student (for example, history).
- Update the student's math grade if it's below 60 (increase it by 10).
- Calculate the average grade for each student.
- Print the updated student data, including the average grade.
```python
students = {
    'Alice': {'math': 85, 'science': 90, 'english': 78},
    'Bob': {'math': 56, 'science': 65, 'english': 50},
    'Charlie': {'math': 92, 'science': 88, 'english': 79},
    'David': {'math': 45, 'science': 55, 'english': 61}
}

# Add a new subject 'history' with random grades
for student, grades in students.items():
    grades['history'] = random.randint(50, 100)

# Update math grades if below 60
for student, grades in students.items():
    if grades['math']< 60:
        grades['math']+=10 

# Calculate the average grade for each studen
for student, grades in students.items():
    avg_grade = sum(grades.values()) / len(grades)
    print(f"Student: {student}")
    print(f"Grades: {grades}")
    print(f"Average Grade: {avg_grade:.2f}")
    print("-" * 30)
```
