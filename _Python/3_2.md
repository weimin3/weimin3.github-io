**Excercise:** Infinite Number Guessing Game
Randomly generate an integer between 1 and 100. The user will keep guessing the number until they guess correctly.

```python
import random
number_to_guess = random.randint(1,100)

while True:
    guess_number = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: "))

    if guess_number == number_to_guess:
        print("Congratulations! You guessed the correct number.")
        break
    elif guess_number > number_to_guess:
        print("Too high, try again")
    else:
        print("Too low try again")

```
