# Boolean Types
The boolean type is used to represent one of two values: `True` or `False`. 
- `True` represents a logical truth. It is equivalent to `1` in numeric contexts.
- `False` represents a logical falsehood. It is equivalent to `0` in numeric contexts.
  


# Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values. The result of a comparison is always a boolean value (True or False)

## Greater Than (>)
Checks if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right.
```python
5 > 3 
# Output: True
```

## Equal To (==)
Checks if the value on the left is equal to the value on the right.
```python
4 == 4
# Output: True
```

## Less Than (<)
Checks if the value on the left is less than the value on the right.
```python
2 < 5 
# Output: True
```

## Greater Than or Equal To (>=)
Checks if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right.
```python
5 >= 5
# Output: True
```

## Less Than or Equal To (<=)
Checks if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right.
```python
3 <= 4 
# Output: True
```

## Not Equal To (!=)
Checks if the value on the left is not equal to the value on the right.
```python
5 != 3
# Output: True
```
