String comparison is done based on the ASCII (or Unicode) values of the characters. When comparing two strings, Python compares them character by character, from left to right.

# Rules for string comparison
1. Character-by-character comparison: The first character of string A is compared with the first character of string B.If a character in A has a higher ASCII value than the corresponding character in B, A is considered greater than B.
   
2. If one string is a prefix of another: If two strings are identical up to the length of the shorter one, the longer string is considered greater.For example, "abc" is less than "abcd".

# ASCII Table Values
1. Uppercase letters (A-Z): ASCII values range from 65 to 90.
2. Lowercase letters (a-z): ASCII values range from 97 to 122.
3. Digits (0-9): ASCII values range from 48 to 57.

**Examples**
```python
print("Apple" < "apple")  # True, because 'A' < 'a'
print("apple" > "banana")   # False, since 'a' < 'b'
print("banana" > "apple")   # True, since 'b' > 'a'
print("abc" < "abcd")       # True, 'abc' is shorter
print("apple" == "apple")   # True, strings are equal

```
