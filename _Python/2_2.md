The if statement is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true.

**Syntax**
```python
if condition:
    statements to execute if the condition is true
```
**Example**
```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
```
In the example,the condition age >= 18 is checked. If age is 18 or greater (True), the statement print("You are an adult.") is executed.If the condition is false (e.g., age is less than 18), the code block under the if statement will not be executed.
