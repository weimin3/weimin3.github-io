1. Generate a random number between 1 and 10.
2. Use three layers of nested if..elif..else statements to check the guesses.
3. After each guess, provide feedback whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.

```python
import random

# generate a random number between 1 and 10
number_to_guess = random.randint(1,10)

# ask to input the first guess:
guess1 = int(input("Guess the number(between 1 and 10): "))

if guess1 == number_to_guess:
    print("Congratulations! You guessed the correct number.")
else:
    if guess1 > number_to_guess:
        print("Too high!")
    else:
        print("Too low!")

    # ask to input the second guess:
    guess2 = int(input("Guess the number(between 1 and 10): "))

    if guess2 == number_to_guess:
        print("Congratulations! You guessed the correct number.")
    else:
        if guess2 > number_to_guess:
            print("Too high!")
        else:
            print("Too low!")
        
        # ask to input the third guess:
            guess3 = int(input("Guess the number(between 1 and 10): "))

            if guess3 == number_to_guess:
                print("Congratulations! You guessed the correct number.")
            else:
                if guess3 > number_to_guess:
                    print("Too high!")
                else:
                    print("Too low!")

# Reveal the correct number after all attempts
print(f"The correct number was {number_to_guess}.")
```
