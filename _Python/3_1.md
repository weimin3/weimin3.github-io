**Syntax**
```python
while condition:
    # Code block to be executed repeatedly
    # Loop will continue as long as the condition is true
```
**Excercise:** Sum of Numbers from 1 to 100
```python
total_sum = 0
i = 1
while i < 101:
    total_sum += i
    i +=1
print(f"The sum of numbers from 1 to 100 is: {total_sum}")
```
