# File Reading
**Syntax**
```python
f = open(file_name, mode, encoding)
```
- mode: `r ` for read, `w` for write, `a` for append.
- encoding: Specifies the character encoding (e.g., "UTF-8" for UTF-8 encoding).
```python
f = open("D:/test.txt", "r", encoding="UTF-8")
```

# Read Operations
- `read()`:
```python
content = f.read()  # Read the entire file
content = f.read(10)  # Read 10 bytes
```
- `readlines()`: Reads all the lines of the file and returns them as a list where each line is an element.
```python
lines = f.readlines()  # Returns a list of lines
```
- `readline()`: Reads a single line from the file
```python
line = f.readline()  # Read the first line of the file
```
- `for`:To iterate over each line in a file.
```python
for line in f:
    print(line.strip())  # Print each line without trailing newline characters
```
# Close
- `f.close()`:the file `F` is closed
- use the `with` statement, which automatically closes the file when the block is exited.
```python
with open('python.txt', 'r') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()  # File is automatically closed after this block
```
# Exercise
Copy the following content into a text editor, save it as `word.txt` and use the code below to count the occurrences of the word "today"

**Content for `word.txt`**:
```python
today is Sunday
Marry go to school for celebrating something
she feels very good and very happy today
today is also a special day
because today is a sunny day
```
**Method 1:**
```python
f = open("D:/word.txt", "r", encoding="UTF-8")
content = f.read()
count = content.count("today")
print(f"There are {count} 'today' occurrences.")
f.close()
```
**Method 2:**
```python
f = open("D:/word.txt", "r", encoding="UTF-8")
count = 0
for line in f:
    line = line.strip()  # Remove leading/trailing whitespace
    words = line.split(" ")  # Split the line into words
    for word in words:
        if word == "today":
            count += 1
print(f"There are {count} 'today' occurrences.")
f.close()
```
