A tuple is a data structure that can store multiple elements, potentially of different data types. **However, unlike lists, tuples are immutable, meaning that once they are defined, their contents cannot be modified.**

# Defining a Tuple
- Literal Syntax: (element1, element2, element3, ...)
- Tuple Variable: variable_name = (element1, element2, ...)
- Empty Tuple: there are two ways to define an empty tuple using:`variable_name = ()` and `variable_name = tuple()`

**Important Notes :** If a tuple contains only one element, a comma must be added after the element, otherwise it will be recognized as a string. Example: `t = ('hello',)` defines a **tuple**, whereas `t = ('hello')` defines a **string**.

# Operations
## Finding an Element's Index
- `tuple_name.index(element)`:Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element.
  
## Counting Elements
- `tuple_name.count(element)`: Counts how many times an element appears in the tuple.
- `len(tuple)`: Returns the number of elements in the tuple.

# Exercise
- Define a tuple that stores a student's information: (name, age, hobbies). The hobbies element is a list that can be modified.
- Query the index of the student's age in the tuple.
- Retrieve the student's name from the tuple.
- Remove "football" from the student's hobbies list.
- Add "coding" to the student's hobbies list.
  
```python
# Define a tuple that stores a student's information
students_info = ('Tom',22,["football", "music", "reading"])

# Query the index of the student's age in the tuple
age_index = students_info.index(22)
print(f"The index of age 22 is: {age_index}")

# Retrieve the student's name from the tuple.
name = students_info[0]
print(f"The student's name is: {name}")

# Remove "football" from the student's hobbies list.
students_info[2].remove("football")
print(f"Hobbies after removing 'football': {students_info[2]}")

# Add "coding" to the student's hobbies list.
students_info[2].append("coding" )
print(f"Hobbies after adding 'coding': {students_info[2]}")
```
