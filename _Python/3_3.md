**multiplication table**

a `while` loop is used to print the multiplication table.
```python
# Initialize the row counter
i = 1
while i <= 9:
    # Initialize the column counter
    j = 1
    while j <= i:
        # Print the multiplication result with tab (\t) for alignment
        print(f"{i} * {j} = {i*j}", end = '\t')
        # Increment the column counter
        j += 1

    # After printing one row, move to the next line
    print()
    # Increment the row counter
    i += 1
```
