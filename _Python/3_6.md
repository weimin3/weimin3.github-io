# Break
The `break` statement is used to **exit a loop entirely**. When encountering a break, it immediately stops the loop, regardless of the current iteration or condition.

**Example**
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        break  # Loop exits when i equals 3
    print(i)
```
Output
```python
1
2
```
The loop stops when `i == 3` because of the `break` statement.

# Continue

The continue statement **skips the rest of the code in the current iteration** and moves on to the next iteration of the loop.
**Example**
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue  # Skips the iteration when i equals 3
    print(i)
```
Output
```python
1
2
4
5
```
The loop skips printing 3 and moves to the next iteration.
