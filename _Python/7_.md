**Basic Syntax**
```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
except:
    # Code to execute if an exception occurs
```
**Example**

Want to open a file in 'read' mode. If the file doesn't exist, an exception occurs, and can handle it by opening the file in 'write' mode
```python
try:
    f = open('linux.txt', 'r')
except:
    f = open('linux.txt', 'w')
```

**Capturing Specific Exceptions**
```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
except FileNotFoundError:
    # Handle file not found
except IOError:
    # Handle input/output error
```

**Capturing Multiple Exceptions**
```python
try:
    f = open('linux.txt', 'r')
except (FileNotFoundError, IOError):
    print("File not found or an input/output error occurred.")
```

**Catching All Exceptions**
To catch any kind of exception,
```python
try:
    f = open('D:/123.txt', 'r')
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

```
**The `else` Clause**

The `else` clause is used to define code that should execute **only if no exception occurs** in the try block.
```python
try:
    print(1)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
else:
    print("No exceptions occurred, running else block.")
```

**The `finally` Clause**

The finally block contains code that always runs, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. **Itâ€™s often used for cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources.**
```python
try:
    f = open('test.txt', 'r')
except Exception as e:
    f = open('test.txt', 'w')
else:
    print("No exception occurred.")
finally:
    f.close()  # This runs no matter what
```
