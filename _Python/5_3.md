**Note**
- Strings are immutable, meaning the elements within a string cannot be modified.
- Strings can only store characters.

# Common Operations
Given the string S = "how are you":
1. Accessing Elements by Index
   - To access the first element ('h'):
  ```python
  value = S[0]
  ```
   - To access the first element using a negative index:
  ```python
  value = S[-11]
  ```
2. Finding the Index of `a` Character
   ```python
   a_index = S.index('a)
   ```
3. Replacing Substrings
   - Replaces all spaces with '|'
  ```python
  new_S = S.replace(' ', '|')
  ```
4. Splitting Strings
   - Splits the string by spaces
  ```python
  words_list = S.split(" ")
  ```
5. Stripping Characters
   -  Removes leading and trailing whitespace
  ```python
  stripped_S = S.strip()
  ```
6. Counting Occurrences of `o` Character
  ```python
  count_o = S.count('o')  # Counts occurrences of 'o'
  ```
7. Calculating Length of String
   ```python
   length_of_string = len(S)  # Length of the string
   ```
