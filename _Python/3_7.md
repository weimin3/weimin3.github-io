**Number Guessing Game with Multiple Attempts**

- Randomly generate a number between 1 and 100.
- Allow the user to guess the number with up to 5 attempts.
- After each guess, inform the user whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.
- Allow the user to quit or continue playing after each game.

```python
import random
number_to_guess = random.randint(1,100)
attempts = 5
for attempt in range(1,attempts+1):
    print(f"attemp {attempt} / {attempts}")
    user_guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 100:")
    
    # Check if the input is a valid integer
    if not user_guess.isdigit():
        print("Invalid input! Please enter a valid number.")
        continue
    user_guess = int(user_guess)

    # Check if the input is within the valid range  
    if user_guess <1 or user_guess >100:
        print("Please guess a number between 1 and 100.")
        continue

    # Check if the guess is correct
    if user_guess == number_to_guess:
        print(f"Congratulations! You guessed the correct number {number_to_guess} in {attempt} attempts.")
        break
    elif user_guess < number_to_guess:
        print("Too low!")
    else:
        print("Too high!")

    # If this was the last attempt, inform the player
    if attempt == attempts:
        print(f"Sorry, you've used all {attempts} attempts. The correct number was {number_to_guess}.")

```
